# SIP – Simple Integration Platform

SIP (Simple Integration Platform) is a tool designed to make **backend development and API integration** accessible to everyone—regardless of coding experience. With a straightforward UI, users can **connect** to databases, files, caches, or other APIs, **design** custom endpoints, and **define** how data flows between them. Whether you’re a seasoned developer looking for rapid integration or a newcomer who wants to build simple automation, SIP aims to give you a versatile, no-fuss approach to creating APIs.

## Key Features

1. **Easy Connections**  
   Link to files, databases, caches (e.g., Redis), or even remote APIs. You can configure credentials and paths without digging into code.

2. **Visual Path Designer**  
   Define your endpoint (e.g., `/storefile`, `/getUser`) and specify how the request’s data (headers, body, query params) should be processed, validated, or transformed.

3. **Flexible Plugin Experience**  
   Not satisfied with built-in functionality (like our default caching)? Write your own! SIP generates a plugin template in languages including **Python**, **Java**, **JavaScript**, **Go**, and **Lua**. You decide what data is passed to your custom code, implement the logic any way you like, and return the file to SIP. We’ll embed it directly into your application so you can tailor every detail without rewriting our entire platform.

4. **Conditional Logic & Flows**  
   Decide what happens if a key is invalid or inactive, if a database call fails, or if you need different actions based on request data. Make it easy to form success and error responses.

5. **Built-In Auth & Rate Limiting**  
   Secure your endpoints with API keys or other methods, throttle excessive usage, and track who’s making which requests.

6. **Automatic Code Generation**  
   SIP can create boilerplate code for your endpoints, handling multiple threads or workers for each. You choose how you want to allocate threads per endpoint.

## Example Scenario

Imagine wanting to store files under an API key–protected endpoint:

1. **Create a Redis Connection**  
   - Store API keys with statuses (`active` or `inactive`).

2. **Create an S3 Connection**  
   - Upload user files to a folder named after their API key.

3. **Design the Endpoint**  
   - **Path**: `/storefile`  
   - **Header**: `X-API-Key` for authentication  
   - **Body**: File payload

4. **Define the Flow**  
   - Check Redis to ensure `X-API-Key` is active.  
   - If active, upload the file to the user’s folder in S3.  
   - Otherwise, return an error message.

5. **Logging & Rate Limit**  
   - Log each upload request.  
   - Set a request limit to avoid abuse.

6. **Plugins**  
   - Don’t like our caching strategy? Generate a **Python** plugin skeleton, fill it in with your own approach, and hand it back to SIP. We’ll incorporate it seamlessly into your API flow.

## Roadmap

- **Keep Implementing Fetchers**  
  Continue adding support for the various fetchers already defined in `format.json`. These fetchers help map request data to different sources (e.g., databases, caches).

- **UI Not Ready Yet**  
  We’re still refining how to **handle requests** and **parse data** into a fully usable code generator. Once that flow is stable, a user-friendly interface will be built on top of it.

- **Update `format.json`**  
  Expand and refine the schema to handle more cases (e.g., new data types, conditional flows, additional plugin triggers).

## Motivation

Growing up fascinated by game stats (like those from Hypixel or Clash Royale) led to a wish: a **friendly** tool for building APIs—no heavy backend experience required. SIP was built to help:

- Non-developers, tinkerers, or front-end devs on tight timelines.  
- Anyone needing a quick prototype or personal project with minimal fuss.  
- Those who, like a younger me, want to create and share data-driven services and experiments.

SIP is more than just a code generator—it’s a **platform** for building flexible integrations, without being stuck with a one-size-fits-all approach.
